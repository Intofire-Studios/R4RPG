# R4RPG ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Latest-1.2.0.2/master-blue.svg)
Text RPG game using Python.
### Game info:
You are a character. The world has been invaded by various types of enemies that you will need to fight in various locations (in Sands, Snow Kingdom, etc.). Gradually, the enemies will become stronger and stronger, and you will need to pump for Skill Points. You will be able to improve the strength of the Healing Potion, Power Potion, your Power and your amount of health. Also, you will be able to travel to other locations, but in what way? It's very simple: after the battle, you may get a pass to the next location with a chance of <1%. Well... there is another way — to buy it in the Shop for coins. All this is waiting for you in R4RPG!
